# Olympic Medals Table

Simple app to allow a basic Olympic Medals Table to be displayed in a browser.

## Description
The application allows you to select a country from a list that is retrieved from an external API. After selecting a country, we enter the number of medals that our selected country has won. After approving the form, the country will be added to the table, which we can sort by the number of medals, and remove the country from the table.
